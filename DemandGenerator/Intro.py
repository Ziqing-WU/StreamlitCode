# Demand Estimation 
Demand estimation model provides scenarios of demands for new circular service on each product model, at each city and during each period, serves as the input of Decision Support System for circular supply chain network design.
The outline of the whole PhD project is shown as below. The demand estimation model is one of the three main components presented here.

        The framework is applied to the case of electric retrofitting of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, inspired by a start-up where I spent 8 months observing their operations. The filters are defined as follows:
        - Filter 1: Legislative and Technical Constraints
            - Legislative Constraints
                - Vehicle Category: L, M, N, not registered as collection vehicle
                - Vehicle Age: more than 3 years for category L, more than 5 years for category M, N
                - Vehicle Engine: at least one spark-ignition or compression engine
                - Geographical Coverage: registered in France
            - Technical Constraints
                - Vehicle Type : M1, N1
                - Vehicle Engine: diesel / petrol
                - Engine Power: between 60 kW and 110 kW
                - and other constraints on weights, noise, CO2 emission, etc
        - Filter 2: Strategies and Business Model of the Company
            - Geographical Coverage: urban area
            - Vehicle Model Selection: last vehicle of the model is fabricated at least 5 years ago / models with most vehicles
            - Consumer Type: toB / toC
        - Filter 3: Consumer Purchasing Intention Analysis
            - Executive Factors Identification (click the following expander for an example)
        - Filter 4: Competitiveness of the Company
