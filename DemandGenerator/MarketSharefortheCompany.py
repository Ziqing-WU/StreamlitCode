    # Demand Estimation for the Company
    In this case study, estimating the demand specifically for the company (DEC) is not necessary because there is only one company operating in this market. 
    With no competitors, the entire market demand identified in the Demand Estimation for the Market (DEM) effectively represents the company's potential demand. 
    Therefore, the competitiveness assessment, which allocates market share among multiple companies based on their competitive positions, becomes irrelevant.

    If, in the future, competitors enter the market, the competitiveness assessment can be applied to estimate market shares. 
    This would involve using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques to evaluate each company's strengths in areas like service quality, pricing, brand recognition, and sustainability performance. 
    By doing so, the DEM can be refined to determine the DEC, representing each company's realistic share of the market demand.
